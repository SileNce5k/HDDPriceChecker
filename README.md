# HDD Price Checker

It only supports one site at the moment (dustinhome.no), but I'd like to add support for more. I'd also like to have amazon, but they block scrapers so I gotta find out how to circumvent that...

---

Sites I want to add in the future (mostly norwegian sites because I am):

* Komplett.no
* Amazon.com (could also do some more european amazon sites like .de, .se and .co.uk)
* Proshop.no
* Maybe some more US sites.


Other things I want to do:

* Sorting tables (Default should be by name, capacity, price)
* When I add more sites, add the ability to choose which store to use to
    * Default to the cheapest option
* Automatic currency rate updating
* Use SQL instead of JSON
* Add a link to another item
* Merge to only use one language (probably javascript)
* My own CSS
